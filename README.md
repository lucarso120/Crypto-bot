# A quick response to a responsive market

This project is made more as a free time play. It retrieves Elon Musks' tweets that mention words related to cryptocurrencies. Then processes a sentiment analysis with _vader_ to define wether its a positive or negative tweet.
If positive, executes an order.

Some aspects of the code are still to be built:
1. Define the amount to be exchanged
2. Expand the dict containing the triggering tickers
3. Define the interval to execute the orders and look for new tweets
